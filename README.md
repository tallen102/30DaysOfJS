# 30 Days Of JavaScript: My Journey

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tiya a senior CS student at Gannon, and this repository is a snapshot of my journey through the 30 Days of JavaScript challenge. This initiative is all about dedicating a bit of time every day to get better at JavaScript. I'm excited about pushing my limits and diving deeper into JavaScript, and I'm doing so through building, creating, and problem-solving for 30 straight days. Check out my progress and learn with me!

## What It's All About

The 30 Days of JavaScript challenge is a commitment to code and study JavaScript for 30 days straight. The goal is to build a deeper understanding of this powerful language, its ecosystems, and to develop a stronger skill set. In this repository, you'll find the projects, resources, and documentation of what I learn each day.

## Structure of the Repository

- `projects/`: This directory contains the code for small projects I'll be building.
- `notes/`: Here, I'll be storing snippets and personal notes from each session.
- `challenges/`: Daily challenges and my solutions will be kept in this directory.

## Progress

| Day | Date | Project/Challenge | Notes | 
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10/19/23 | Challenge One| intro: variables & datatypes|


_I'll be updating this table daily with my progress. Stay tuned!_
